NOTES, PITCHES, AND SO ON
---------------------------------------

A note is composed of an (optional)
pitch and a duration.

Notes are specified in terms of three
nibbles, of the form

  abcd efgh ijkl

silent
  note is silent if all bits are unset.

time info:
  each note begins as a sixteenth note.
  if e is set, the length if doubled.
  if h is set, the note is made into a
  dotted note.

pitch offset from base:
  pitches are specified in a scale
  relative to some base note.
  these bits are 4-bit signed relative
  to that base.
