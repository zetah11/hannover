4 BIT WAVETABLE INSTRUCTION SET, TAKE 2
---------------------------------------

The WTVM has a wavetable that is highly
cyclical in nature. It is a 2D table,
which means it acts as a function from
an X, Y coordinate pair to a value R.

X and Y work modulo 1, which means that
X + 1 ~ X, and Y + 1 ~ Y.

The WTVM consists of 16 instructions,
each of which modify the state of the
wavetable in some way.

The WTVM has N cursors, each of which
point to a specific X, Y coordinate in
the wavetable. An instruction may
either modify these cursors, the data
they point to, or N - the number of
cursors.

Unless otherwise specified, 'data'
refers to the entries pointed to by
all cursors, and 'neighborhood' refers
to the data values surrounding the ones
pointed to by all cursors.

0000  0  no-op
0001  1  multiply the x coordinate of
         the cursor by the prime of the
         following nibble, and the y
         coordinate of the cursor by
         the prime of 16 - the
         following nibble
0010  2  introduce a cursor at the
         smallest x, y pair furthest
         away from all the other
         cursors
0011  3  multiply the data by the
         prime of the following nibble,
         wrapping on overflow
0100  4  slant the neighborhood
0101  5  smooth the neighborhood
0110  6  substitute the data by the
         Rijndael S-Box
0111  7  interpret the data as a pair
         of the top 4-bits of an 8-bit
         two's complement signed
         integer, and modify the X, Y
         coordinates of the cursor by
         that, wrapping on overflow.
1000  8  move each cursor diagonally by
         its position, starting with
         the cursor at the index
         specified by the prime of the
         following nibble
1001  9  transpose the wavetable
1010  a  remove the oldest cursor,
         unless there is only one
1011  b  3x3 gaussian blur
1100  c  [unused]
1101  d  [unused]
1110  e  [unused]
1111  f  [unused]
