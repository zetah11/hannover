STEPWISE MELODY MAKER
---------------------------------------

Melodies are constructed by starting at
some note, and iteratively moving up or
down by specific intervals.

0mmm  adjust pitch by an interval of
      mmm
10dd  hold the current pitch for a
      duration of dd
11dd  invert the previous interval for
      a duration of dd

Intervals:

000   1
001   1
010   2
011   3
100  -1
101  -1
110  -2
111  -3
